The first order of pitch selection for all brass instruments is producing a partial from the harmonic series. When the euphonium is played open (no keys or triggers depressed), the concert pitch of the fundamental is the B-flat below the bass clef, the same as the trombone. Note that the partials are successively closer together, and that the 7th partial is "out of tune."

Almost all euphoniums have a 4th valve, extra tubing brought into play by a trigger operated by the left index finger. Like the trombone's F attachment (or "F trigger"), it increases the tubing's total length by a third, so that the instrument's open fundamental is lowered to the F an octave below the bass clef. The pitches played here are 2nd partials (not pedal tones).
42
The valves lower the pitch of the fundamental by adding tubing to the air column. The euphonium uses piston valves played by the right hand. The 2nd valve (middle finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a half-step. The 1st valve (index finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a whole-step. The 3rd valve lowers the fundamental an additional minor 3rd. This allows for a chromatic scale of seven different fundamentals, enough to fill in the perfect-5th gap between the 2nd and 3rd partials.

These fingerings operate similarly to the line above, with the addition of the 4th valve, which lowers everything a perfect 4th. Unlike the trombone's F attachment, this 4th valve invokes a compensation as extra tubing is needed, making all 7 valve position down to B-natural playable and in tune.

With the availability of the 4th valve, the standard range of the euphonium extends for 3 octaves. 

The euphonium is sometimes called tenor tuba in orchestral scores; some composers consider the baritone horn and the euphonium the same instrument, though the baritone horn has a narrower bore and sometimes lacks a 4th valve. Since the baritone horn is predominantly cylindrical bore, its timbre resembles a bass trumpet (or bass bugle), while the conical bore euphonium is clearly a tenor tuba.

86
Pedal tones extend the range of the euphonium downward. Pedal tones lower than the G here are rarely called for.
100
Using the 4th valve, a very accomplished player can perform pedal tones in an extreme low range comparable to the bass trombone and tuba.
116
The euphonium maintains its rich singing color up to B-flat in the treble clef; higher pitches are less solid. The top of this range is available only very accomplished players.

Skips require non-adjacent partial selection by the embouchure. 

Here the skips are from the 3rd to 6th partial.

Here the skips are from the 6th to 3rd partial. Downward skips are slightly less immediate in their response.

As the pitches get higher, the partials are closer together and more fingerings are possible for any given pitch. The change in color is slight, but it is interesting to hear the intonation variety and articulation created by the change of fundamentals (note that this example is slurred). Here D is played as the 5th partial of B-flat, the 6th partial of G, the 7th partial of E and the 8th partial D (using the 4th valve).

Trills and tremolos on the euphonium are executed with valve fingering alternation.
19
Trills and tremolos on the euphonium are executed with valve fingering alternation. Here the 4th valve is used to create a whole-step trill. Note that even though the fingering here is exactly the same as demonstrated at the of the first line of the previous page, the speed of the trill and the inertia of the sound wave combine to a rising 2nd rather than a falling 4th. 
25
Trills and tremolos on the euphonium are executed with valve fingering alternation. As the interval of the tremolo widens, the embouchure must also adjust to alternating partials and greater resistance from the inertia of the air column.

The precise, immediate changes in the length of the column of air created by the valve mechanism provide a basic clarity of articulation on brass instruments, even when played legato with no tonguing.
6
Slur-two-tongue-two articulation is very common and effective on brass instruments.
11
Single tonguing is generally slower than the other articulation options demonstrated here, but is also the most deliberate and forceful.
16
Double-tonguing is very effective for fast passages on brass instruments.
21
Staccato articulation is effective in all but the lowest registers of the euphonium.

26
Triple-tonguing can be very effective on all brass instruments. It must be remembered that when triple-tonguing skips (as in this example) the amount of preparation time moving into the new note is considerably shortened, making the attacks less secure.
29
Flutter-tonguing is effective throughout the range of the euphonium. Individual players may prefer to use the front or back of the tongue.

A slight amount of vibrato is normal on the euphonium, applied according to the taste and discretion of the performer. Composers may specify varying amounts of vibrato.

Pitch-bend can be effectively performed by using a "half-valve" technique, creating a moment of instability between the pitches, which can be controlled by the embouchure.

While it is recommended that the kind of mute be specified for trumpet and trombone, on other brass instruments (including the euphonium) "muted" unambiguously designates the straight mute.

PLEASE NOTE: A significant amount of time must be given for the player to place and remove mutes.

Note that the use of the mute on the euphonium may be perceived more as a color change than a dynamic change.

Writing "brassy" invites the player to add a metallic quality to the tone color. This is possible only at a loud dynamic level.

This excerpt from Richard Strauss's "Don Quixote" not only displays the exceptional agility of the instrument, but also a character that is perfectly suited to its sound and articulation qualities.
