Tubas come in a variety of sizes, the most common being the F (open fundamental is the F an octave below the bass clef), the CC, and the BB-flat (open fundamental is B-flat at the bottom of the piano keyboard). Even though the tubing of the BB-flat is half again as long as the F tuba, the available low range is virtually the same in both instruments, and the sound quality can be almost identical.

Performer: James Saliers
Most American tubists will bring an F tuba and a CC tuba to performances, and choose from a wide selection of mouthpieces to provide the sound and range characteristics appropriate to the music. 
Here is the harmonic series from the pedal C of the CC tuba.
25
The valves lower the pitch of the fundamental by adding tubing to the air column. The tuba uses piston valves played by the right hand. 
These arpeggios move from the 2nd to the 6th partial of each fundamental.

The valves lower the pitch of the fundamental by adding tubing to the air column. The tuba uses piston valves played by the right hand. The 2nd valve (middle finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a half-step.

The valves lower the pitch of the fundamental by adding tubing to the air column. The tuba uses piston valves played by the right hand. The 2nd valve (middle finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a half-step. The 1st valve (index finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a whole-step.

The 2nd valve (middle finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a half-step. The 1st valve (index finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a whole-step. The 3rd valve lowers the fundamental an additional minor 3rd.
37
Instead of using the combination 1-3 to play a perfect 4th below the open instrument, the tubist may use the 4th valve (operated by the right hand little finger), which lowers the fundamental a perfect 4th.
40
Here the combination 2-4 lowers the pitch a half-step and a perfect 4th.

This scale is performed on the F tuba. This same 3-octave range (plus additional pedal tones) is available on all sizes of tuba, but the high range is more secure on the smaller instrument.

Pedal tones on the CC tuba are solid down to its lowest C. 
Note that in this range especially the tuba requires a great deal of breath.

As the pitches get higher, the partials are closer together and more fingerings are possible for any given pitch. The change in color is slight, but it is interesting to hear the intonation variety and articulation created by the change of fundamentals (note that this example is slurred). Here concert D is played as the 9th partial of C, the 10th partial of B-flat, and the 12th partial of G. The G fundamental is created by operating the right-hand-thumb trigger in combination with the 1st and 2nd valves.
99
Half-step trills are effectively performed using the 2nd valve.
102
Whole-step trills are generally less effective, employing the 1st valve.

As the interval of the tremolo widens, the embouchure must also adjust to alternating partials and greater resistance from the inertia of the air column.

As the interval of the tremolo widens, the embouchure must also adjust to alternating partials and greater resistance from the inertia of the air column.
This tremolo is created entirely by the embouchure alternating between the 6th and 8th partials.

The precise, immediate changes in the length of the column of air created by the valve mechanism provide a basic clarity of articulation on brass instruments, even when played legato with no tonguing.
8
Slur-two-tongue-two articulation is very common and effective on brass instruments.
16
Single tonguing is generally slower than the other articulation options demonstrated here, but is also the most deliberate and forceful.
23
Double-tonguing is very effective for fast passages on brass instruments.
29
Staccato articulation is effective in all but the highest and lowest registers of the tuba.

Triple-tonguing can be very effective on all brass instruments. It must be remembered that when triple-tonguing skips (as in this example) the amount of preparation time moving into the new note is considerably shortened, making the attacks less secure.
5
Flutter-tonguing is effective throughout all but the very lowest range of the tuba.

A slight amount of vibrato is normal on the tuba, applied according to the taste and discretion of the performer. Composers may specify varying amounts of vibrato.

While it is recommended that the kind of mute be specified for trumpet and trombone, on other brass instruments (including the tuba) "muted" unambiguously designates the straight mute.
PLEASE NOTE: A significant amount of time must be given for the player to place and remove mutes. As can be seen, this is particularly the case for the tuba.
Note that the use of the mute on the tuba may be perceived more as a color change than a dynamic change.

Writing "brassy" invites the player to add a metallic quality to the tone color with a forcefully sharp attack. This is possible only at a loud dynamic level and is most effective in the tuba's lower range.

This passage from Wagner's Prelude to "Die Meistersinger" exhibits the singing high range of the tuba, including music literature's most recognized tuba trill.
Note the color change created by articulation from non-legato to molto legato. Notice also that breaths need to be taken in spite of the composer's seeming indifference to that need.
