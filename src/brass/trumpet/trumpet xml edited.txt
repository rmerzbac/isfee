The first order of pitch selection for all brass instruments is producing a partial from the harmonic series. \n\n" +
" When the B-flat trumpet is played open (no keys depressed), the concert pitch of the fundamental is the B-flat in the bass clef. \n\n" +
" The first partial (pedal tone) is barely playable; the lowest usable partial is the 2nd partial. \n\n" +
" Note that the partials are successively closer together, and that the 7th partial is \"out of tune.\" ",
29: "The valves lower the pitch of the fundamental by adding tubing to the air column. \n\n" +
" The trumpet uses piston valves played by the right hand. \n\n" +
" The 2nd valve (middle finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a half-step. \n\n" +
" The 1st valve (index finger) adds enough tubing to lower the fundamental a whole-step. \n\n" +
" The 3rd valve lowers the fundamental an additional minor 3rd. \n\n" +
" This allows for a chromatic scale of seven different fundamentals, enough to fill in the perfect-5th gap between the 2nd and 3rd partials. ",
45: "The lower two octaves of the trumpet's range can be played with assurance and tonal flexibility. ",
60: "Pitches above the staff are brilliant, but are more difficult to control. ",
64: "Above concert C above the staff the timbre of the trumpet loses its fullness. \n\n" +
" Most orchestral trumpet players are not comfortable in this range. \n\n" +
" Using a C trumpet or even a D trumpet has little effect on the playability or timbre of these pitches. \n\n" +
" For a distinct difference in timbre and agility, see the Piccolo Trumpet unit. ",
71: "Skips of up to an octave in either direction may be slurred with little difficulty. ",
77: "Skips of up to an octave in either direction may be slurred with little difficulty. ",
82: "As the pitches get higher, the partials are closer together and more fingerings are possible for any given pitch. \n\n" +
" The change in color is slight, but it is interesting to hear the intonation variety and articulation created by the change of fundamentals (note that this example is slurred). \n\n" +
" Here concert D is played on the B-flat trumpet as the 5th partial of B-flat, the 6th partial of G, and the 7th partial of E.",
