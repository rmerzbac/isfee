The B-flat piccolo trumpet is an invention whose principal function is to make Baroque high clarino trumpet parts more manageable. It is half the size of the standard B-flat trumpet, with partials sounding an octave higher than that instrument.
The 4th valve (played with the little finger) adds tubing to lower the fundamental a perfect 4th, making the lowest note of this scale playable.</commentary>

Note that the range is not extended an octave higher, but that the security and agility of the high range is greatly enhanced.</commentary>

		<commentary>This passage from the "Credo" of Bach's B-minor Mass was originally written for a valveless trumpet whose fundamental is the D below the bass clef -- almost twice as long as a modern C trumpet. Here an extended lead pipe is used to pitch the modern piccolo trumpet in A. 
The score shows Bach's original transposition, the concert pitch result, and the way it would be notated for a modern piccolo trumpet in A, although trumpeters may prefer to transpose as they read from the original part.</commentary>
