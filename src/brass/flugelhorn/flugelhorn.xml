The flugelhorn is a mostly conical bore instrument that is mellower and less brilliant than the trumpet. Its deeper mouthpiece cup darkens the sound.</commentary>

The flugelhorn is not usually thought of as a high-range instrument, but as demonstrated here it can produce notes above the staff while maintaining its fullness and warmth.</commentary>

		<commentary>Mahler's "posthorn" solo from his Third Symphony is often played on the flugelhorn. The dark rich tone of the flugelhorn provides a greater contrast to the trumpet timbre than the cornet.
It is interesting that Mahler, usually a fastidious provider of dynamic and articulation detail, left the solo unmarked, allowing the instrument to speak for itself.</commentary>
