The glockenspiel sounds 2 octaves higher than written; this can be indicated by the use of a treble clef with a \"15\" over it. This low G is the standard bottom note of the glockenspiel's range.
The bars of the glockenspiel are much closer together than one finds on other keyboard percussion, which makes fast complex passages somewhat unidiomatic.

Crotales are heavy metal discs that are richer in color and longer-lasting in tone than the metal bars of the glockenspiel. The octave shown here is the higher octave available, but a lower octave is not rare. The pitches are written using the same convention as the glockenspiel, that is, sounding 2 octaves higher than written.

The range of chimes (also called \"tubular bells\") extends from middle C to the F at the top of the treble staff. Because of the position needed to play them, chime parts need to be temporarily memorized by the player. 
When depressed, the pedal allows the chimes to ring indefinitely; when released, the pedal will damp all the chimes.
The most typical chime mallets are fiberglass and rawhide.

The clef used here (with an 8 over the treble clef symbol) indicates that the xylophone sounds an octave higher than its treble clef notation. Its highest note matches the top note of the piano keyboard, given it an extra octave above the range of the marimba.

Pitches that are ringing with the pedal depressed can be selectively damped with the mallets while other tones continue to ring.

A similar technique entails holding the pedal to allow a chord to ring, and then damping each note of a melody as the next one is played, creating a clean legato melody over a sustained chord.

This example uses a rare 4-octave vibraphone and demonstrates the change in color created by varying the motor speed.

Every composer who sees or hears a grand marimba like this one wants to write down to the C below the bass clef. Please observe what the extra notes below where this scale begins add to the size (and therefore transportability and expense) of the instrument. The low A which begins this scale should be considered the practical standard bottom of the marimba's range. 

Note that it takes the performer about 4 steps to walk through this 4-octave range.

Scales (and similarly, passages) which have \"black keys\" are actually easier to play than all-white scales and passages. The \"black keys\" give the performer very useful points of reference.

Typically, softer mallets which emphasize the sustained part of the pitch and suppress the noise of the attack are used in the lower range of the marimba. 
The rubber mallets used here are relatively hard, making for a sharp mixed pitch attack. If other instruments are playing in this range, only the higher part of the marimba attacks will be heard.
