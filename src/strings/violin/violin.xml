Unlike large string instruments (see cello and contrabass for comparison), violin string length allows the performer to cover a perfect 4th comfortably, making it possible to play a scale using all four fingers on each of the strings.

As the performer shifts to higher and higher positions the notes and closer and closer together (and consequently, more difficult to play in tune and to \"find\" from a leap or as an entrance).

		 12:  "Please note: An extended demonstration of string multiple-stop chords can be found in the section on the cello.
As one plays in higher positions, the adjacent strings get farther and farther apart, and also farther from the fingerboard. This makes perfect 5ths in the higher positions awkward and difficult to play in tune. When a perfect 5th is played as harmonics, the problems created by having to press the strings down are no longer present.",

Two independent lines can generally be played comfortably on the violin if the harmonic intervals remain between a second and an octave. (The detailed fingerings are given here as a study guide.)",

Natural harmonics use the pitch of the open string as the fundamental. Artificial harmonics require the string to be fully stopped by one finger to create an "artificial" fundamental and lightly touched by another finger to make the string vibrate in partials. By far the most common artificial harmonic is the "touch 4" 4th-partial harmonic (2 octaves above the stopped note), created by lightly touching a perfect 4th above a stopped note on the same string.",

Most types of glissandos are marked with a diagonal line from the first to second pitch; in addition, the word 'gliss.' may optionally be marked.  
Generally string glissandos should be marked with a slur, since they are usually performed in one bow stroke.",

Modern notation practice is that the glissando lasts the entire duration of the note from which it is marked. 
In this case, the glissando begins immediately after the D-flat has sounded and lasts a half note.",

Modern notation practice is that the glissando lasts the entire duration of the note from which it is marked. 
This rhythmic notation is used to indicate a longer sustained D-flat and a faster glissando.",
		 46:  "Although an upward glissando is an inherently dramatic gesture, it should be noted that notes in high positions on low strings are less colorful and resonant than the lower pitches.",
		 51:  "An upward glissando to a harmonic is particularly effective, allowing the string to ring freely at its destination pitch. Here the 4th partial is used, 3/4 of the way up the G string.",
		 55:  "Portamento is quick, light audible shift. Unlike glissando, it may involve changing fingers or strings; it does not necessarily connect the pitches without a gap. String players frequently use portamento intuitively as an expressive device.",

		 0:  Single pizzicato notes are usually all played with the index finger of the right hand. Most orchestral string players have not developed a multi-finger pizzicato technique. If there is time to set the bow down, pizzicato playing can better controlled.</commentary>

		 12:  Double-stop pizzicatos may be played with the index and middle finger, or (as in this performance) as a fast strum (if the strings are adjacent).</commentary>
		 18:  Pizzicato triple and quadruple stops are usually arpeggiated with one finger. If the direction is upward the thumb can strum across the strings. (The direction of the strum should be indicated.)</commentary>
		 26:  Slurred pizzicatos are less effective on the violin and viola than on the cello and contrabass. The pitches of the slur must be on the same string. Notice that the sound quickly decays, except when the second note is the open E string. </commentary>
		 32:  Glissando pizzicato is an interesting but very subtle gesture.</commentary>
		 38:  Snap pizzicato, also called Bartok pizz., is created by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it snaps back against the fingerboard.  Although it is sometimes done by grabbing the string between the thumb and finger, here it is effectively executed with a one-finger technique.</commentary>

		 0:  This passage from Paganini's Caprice #24 in A minor effectively combines the open E string (and one open A) with thirds and 5ths to present powerful triple-stop chords. Note how the second chord uses the open E string doubled with the same page stopped on the A string.</commentary>
		 6:  This passage is the compelling opening to Ysaye's transcription of Saint-Saens Caprice (after a Study in Form of a Waltz). 
The use of the G-string for the first 4 measures gives the opening gesture added depth and virtuoso flair. </commentary>
