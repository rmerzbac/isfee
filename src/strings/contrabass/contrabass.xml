"Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"The standard tuning for the contrabass is used here: perfect 4ths ascending from E. Alternate tuning are more common on the bass than on any other bowed string instrument. \n\n" +
"The lowest string is often tuned down as low as C, and about a third of the basses used by professionals have an extension of the E string's length, making low C possible without re-tuning.",
		4: Performer: Ben Jensen\n\n" +
"Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"Because of the great length of the strings, the intervals in first position  are so far apart that only a major "2nd can be covered by the natural span of the hand.",

"Here the thumb is placed halfway up the G string, sounding the pitch an octave higher than the open string. In thumb position the intervals are twice as close together as in first position.",

		30: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"In spite of the difficulties associated with the size of the instrument, accomplished contrabassists can play with a speed and agility matching the cello.\n\n" +
"Note that the bass bow is shorter than the bows of other strings, so bow changes are correspondingly more frequent.",
		37: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"Trills and tremolos in lower positions on the contrabass are best limited in interval size to a major 2nd.",
		41: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +

"Arpeggios are accomplished through a combination of string crossings and/or shifts.",
		57: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"Because of its perfect 4th tuning, the most comfortable double stops on the contrabass are 3rds and 5ths.",
		68: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"Because of its perfect 4th tuning, the most comfortable double stops on the contrabass are 3rds and 5ths. The minor 6th in this passage requires an extended position.",
		78: Please note: All pitches sound an octave lower than written.\n\n" +
"Octave double stops are comfortable in thumb position, but tuning in this region is a challenge for less advanced players.",
		85: These natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching the string at a node that exists where the notated pitch is located. \n\n" +
"These 2nd through 10th partials (which are shown here on the G string) can be played as natural harmonics on all 4 strings (transposed relative to the open string). High-partial natural harmonics are much more reliable on the contrabass than on smaller string instruments.\n\n" +
"For an extended demonstration of natural harmonics and string length please see the section on the cello.",

"These are artificial 3rd-partial "touch 5" harmonics; the sounding pitch is an octave and a 5th above the stopped note. On the contrabass, these are more common and reliable than the "touch 4" 4th-partial harmonics favored on other members of the string family.\n\n" +
"For an extended demonstration of artificial harmonics, natural harmonics and string length please see the section on the cello.",

		16: "Saltando (also called ricochet) is a throwing of the bow and allowing it to rebound two or more times. It is most effectively applied as a down-bow stroke.",
		22: "Unmeasured tremolo is notated in string writing by three strokes on the note stem, regardless of the rhythmic value of the note. It is played as fast as possible with no regard for the number of alternations on each note; the effect is a color, not a rhythm.",
