The baritone saxophone is written in E-flat: the concert pitch sounds an octave and a major 6th lower than the written pitch. The variety of the tone colors of the different registers of all members of the saxophone family are less pronounced than is the case with other woodwinds.
The lower and middle registers are the most distinctive and colorful.

The baritone saxophone is written in E-flat: the concert pitch sounds an octave and a major 6th lower than the written pitch. The variety of the tone colors of the different registers of all members of the saxophone family are less pronounced than is the case with other woodwinds. As the written pitches go above the staff the color becomes brighter.

The baritone saxophone has an extra low-A key to allow its concert range to extend to low C. The bottom notes of the saxophone are progressively more difficult to play softly as one descends. Quiet attacks are particularly treacherous in this region. The sound is naturally thick and heavy.

The saxophone is constructed in such a way as to provide great consistency of timbre and articulation qualities throughout its standard range. 
This low range is relatively dark and full. Attacking the low C in these examples requires care and skill, particularly at softer dynamic levels.

Saxophone articulation speaks smoothly and consistently throughout its range. 
Even when slurred, each note speaks very clearly.

Saxophone articulation speaks smoothly and consistently throughout its range. 
The slur-two-tongue-two articulation is the most common fast articulation in all wind music.

Saxophone articulation speaks smoothly and consistently throughout its range. 
Single-tonguing is generally slower than the other articulation options demonstrated here, but is also the most deliberate and forceful.
17
Saxophone articulation speaks smoothly and consistently throughout its range. 
Double-tonguing is becoming a more common articulation for saxophonists; it is an option that may be chosen by the performer for fast passages. On the tenor and baritone saxophones, double-tonguing is more difficult in the lower register.

Staccato articulation speaks clearly in all registers of single-reed instruments, though not as precisely and edgy as in double-reed instruments. (Compare this with the corresponding bassoon example.)

An exceptionally hard attack and release creates the effect of \"slap-tonguing.\" Not all saxophonists can execute this effectively.

The saxophone is capable of a large array of multiphonics, although the results can be unpredictable.
