PLEASE NOTE: These pitches would normally be notated in tenor clef. Bass clef is used here to emphasize range relationships.

The timbre of the bassoon extends smoothly down to its lowest note, B-flat. At the bottom of the bassoon's range, it is difficult to play very softly.
36
The extreme high register can sound thin and a bit strained, but this can be an evocative if somewhat unearthly color. The high E is more reliable when approached from a slur.
Treble clef is appropriate for passages which lie in this tessitura.
46
Register skips can be executed with great clarity and agility.

Register skips can be executed with great clarity and agility. Note how these downward slurs encounter slightly more resistance as the octave breaks downward.

This example illustrates one use of \"harmonics\" on the bassoon. Alternate fingerings are available for most pitches. If the fingering is not notated, the performer will find an alternate fingering that will provide a change in color.

As these trills become tremolos, and as the tremolos get wider, note how more fingers are involved in motion. Notice also how the sound wave becomes more resistant to change as the interval grows.

The lowest register of the bassoon is heavy and dark in color. Variations of dynamics and articulations are slightly less responsive than in the middle range.

In the region above middle C the bassoon looses some of its timbral richness and capacity for dramatic contrast, but its plaintive, singing tone can be very expressive.
PLEASE NOTE: These pitches would normally be notated in tenor clef. Bass clef is used here to emphasize range relationships.

The bassoon is very responsive to fast passagework throughout its range. 
Even when slurred, each note speaks with exceptional clarity.

The bassoon is very responsive to fast passagework throughout its range. 
The slur-two-tongue-two articulation is the most common fast articulation in all wind music.
13
The bassoon is very responsive to fast passagework throughout its range.
Single-tonguing is generally slower than the other articulation options demonstrated here, but is also the most deliberate and forceful.

Double-tonguing is not demonstrated here, but it is becoming a more common articulation for bassoonists; it is an option that may be chosen by the performer for fast passages in the middle and high registers.
20
This kind of staccato articulation is possibly more naturally effective on the bassoon than on any other instrument of the orchestra. It is consistent throughout the range of the instrument.

Some vibrato is almost always used on the bassoon, applied according to the taste and discretion of the performer. Composers may specify varying amounts of vibrato, and can expect a significant change of color.
